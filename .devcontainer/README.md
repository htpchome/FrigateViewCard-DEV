# FrigateViewCard DevContainer

A complete development environment for building and testing the FrigateViewCard custom card for Home Assistant with Frigate NVR integration.

## What's Included

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Home Assistant** | `8123` | Home Assistant Core 2026.9.0 with Frigate integration |
| **Frigate NVR** | `5000` | Frigate web UI with 3 demo cameras |
| **go2rtc** | `8554`, `1984` | WebRTC streaming for live camera feeds |
| **Dev Container** | - | Node.js 20 development environment with FFmpeg and Playwright |

Codex is installed automatically and stores its login and conversation history
in the persistent `frigateviewcard-codex-data` Docker volume. Rebuilding the
devcontainer does not require reinstalling or signing in to Codex again.
FFmpeg is installed in the devcontainer image and remains available after every
container rebuild.

The post-create setup installs the project-pinned Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
Playwright engines and their Linux system dependencies. Browser downloads are
stored in the persistent `frigateviewcard-playwright-cache` Docker volume, so
rebuilding the devcontainer does not download them again unless the pinned
Playwright version changes.

Home Assistant is pinned to Core `2026.9.0` in `docker-compose.yml`. This keeps
configuration-editor testing reproducible instead of silently moving whenever
the `stable` container tag changes.

## Quick Start

### 1. Open in DevContainer

**VS Code:**
1. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Open this project in VS Code
3. Press `F1` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build (~2-3 minutes first time)

**GitHub Codespaces:**
1. Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
2. Select "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main"

### 2. Wait for Services to Start

After the container opens, wait 1-2 minutes for all services to initialize. You'll see status messages in the terminal.

### 3. Access Home Assistant

Open your browser to **http://localhost:8123**

On first visit, create a new user account:
- Name: `admin` (or whatever you prefer)
- Password: `admin` (or whatever you prefer)
- Location: Skip or set your location

### 4. Deploy the Card

In the VS Code terminal, run:

```bash
bash .devcontainer/sync-card.sh
```

This copies the generated card and lazy HLS.js companion assets from `dist/` to
Home Assistant's `/config/www/` directory.

### 5. Add the Card to a Dashboard

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Dashboards**
2. Click **Add Dashboard** → Name it "Frigate" → Create
3. Open the new dashboard and click the pencil icon to edit
4. Click **Add Card** → **Manual**
5. Paste this configuration:

```yaml
type: custom:frigate-view-card
cameras:
  - entity: camera.front_door
    name: Front Door
  - entity: camera.backyard
    name: Backyard
  - entity: camera.driveway
    name: Driveway
title: Frigate Cameras
window_days: 3
theme: default
```

6. Click **Save**

## Development Workflow

### Browser compatibility tests

```bash
npm run test:compat:browsers
```

The required Playwright engines are installed automatically when the
devcontainer is created.

### Manual Sync (after each change)

```bash
bash .devcontainer/sync-card.sh
```

Then hard-refresh your browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`).

### Auto-Sync (watch mode)

```bash
bash .devcontainer/watch-card.sh
```

This automatically syncs all card assets whenever a build updates
`dist/frigate-view-card.js`.

### Viewing Logs

**Home Assistant logs:**
```bash
docker exec -it homeassistant tail -f /config/home-assistant.log
```

**Frigate logs:**
```bash
docker exec -it frigate tail -f /dev/shm/logs/frigate.log
```

Or from within the devcontainer:
```bash
# HA logs (if /config is mounted)
cat /config/home-assistant.log
```

## Demo Cameras

The devcontainer includes 3 pre-configured demo cameras using public test videos:

| Camera | Entity | Objects Tracked |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Front Door | `camera.front_door` | person, car, dog, cat |
| Backyard | `camera.backyard` | person, dog, bird |
| Driveway | `camera.driveway` | person, car, truck |

These use sample videos from Google's public storage as RTSP sources via go2rtc.

### Using Your Own Cameras

Edit `.devcontainer/frigate/config.yml` and replace the demo streams with your actual RTSP URLs:

```yaml
go2rtc:
  streams:
    my_camera:
      - "rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.100:554/stream"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Card not showing up

1. Make sure you ran `bash .devcontainer/sync-card.sh`
2. Hard-refresh your browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
3. Check browser console for errors (`F12` → Console)
4. Verify the file exists: `ls /config/www/frigate-view-card.js`

### Home Assistant not starting

```bash
# Check HA container status
docker ps | grep homeassistant

# View HA logs
docker logs homeassistant
```

### Frigate not connecting

1. Check Frigate is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/version`
2. View Frigate logs: `docker logs frigate`
3. Verify config: The demo config uses CPU detection (no GPU required)

### Port conflicts

If ports 8123 or 5000 are already in use on your host:

1. Edit `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`
2. Change the host port mapping:
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "8124:8123"  # Use 8124 instead of 8123
   ```

### Reset everything

To start fresh:

```bash
# From your host machine (not inside the container)
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

Then reopen the devcontainer in VS Code.

## Tips

- **Browser caching**: Home Assistant aggressively caches JavaScript. Always use hard-refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) after syncing changes.
- **Version number**: Update the `VERSION` constant in `src/constants.js` to bust the cache.
- **Multiple browsers**: Test in an incognito/private window to avoid cache issues.
- **Frigate API**: Access the Frigate API directly at `http://localhost:5000/api/` for debugging.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension
- At least 4GB RAM available for Docker
- ~3GB disk space for images and volumes
